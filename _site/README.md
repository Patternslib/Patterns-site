# Patterns

Patterns is a JavaScript library that enables designers to build rich
interactive prototypes without the need for writing any JavaScript. All events
are triggered by classes and other attributes in the HTML, without abusing the
HTML as a programming language. Accessibility, SEO and well structured HTML are
core values of Patterns.

## Browser support

Patterns aims to support at least the two latest major versions of all popular browsers.

Currently that means:

- Apple Safari 5+
- Google Chrome 20+
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 8+

Other browser version may work too, but are not actively tested against.
