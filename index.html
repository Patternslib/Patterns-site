summary: Patternslib, or short 'Patterns' lets you create rich, dynamic and interactive prototypes or websites, without having to know or care about Javascript. Instead, you simply add special CSS classes and HTML5 data attributes to your HTML. These classes and attributes describe "interaction patterns", which add rich functionality to your page. Patterns is both a library of reusable interaction patterns as well as a small framework for creating such patterns.
