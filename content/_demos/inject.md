description: "Injection is one of the most powerful features of Patterns. It makes it trivial to load content from a server and include it on a web page. This can be used to do on-demand loading of content, do in-page form submission, perform AJAX requests with results shown as notifications and many other things. Pat-inject is designed with respect for accessibility and follows the principles of progressive enhancement."
